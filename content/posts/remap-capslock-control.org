I cannot remember the last time that I used the capslock key. This is because it is not useful.
There is never a scenario where it is beneficial or socially acceptable to use the capslock key.

** Why Remap Capslock to Control?

Do yourself a favor, remap capslock to control and enjoy many years of conflict-free typing.
As a side benefit it will also reduce the /hook pinky finger/ from not having to use the control
key all-the-way-down-in-the-bottom-left-corner of the keyboard key.

** How It's Done

1. Open "System Preferences"
2. Click "Keyboard"
3. Click "Modifier Keys"
4. Set Caps Lock to "^ Control"

That's it, you're all set!

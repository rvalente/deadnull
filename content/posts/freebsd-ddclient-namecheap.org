First, we need to install =ddclient= on our FreeBSD machine. For this you can use ports or pkgng.
In this guide I will use pkgng for speed and simplicity.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pkg install ddclient
#+END_SRC

Once installed, configure ddclient to start on boot by running the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sysrc ddclient_enable="YES"
#+END_SRC

Lastly, we need to configure ddclient to talk with namecheap. Here is the configuration options in
order to make this happen. =vi # /usr/local/etc/ddclient.conf=

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
daemon=300                 # check every 300 seconds
syslog=yes                 # log update msgs to syslog
mail=root                  # mail all msgs to root
mail-failure=root          # mail failed update msgs to root
pid=/var/run/ddclient.pid  # record PID in file.
ssl=yes                    # use ssl-support.  Works with
                           # ssl-library

use=web, web=dynamicdns.park-your-domain.com/getip
protocol=namecheap
server=dynamicdns.park-your-domain.com
login=yourdomain.com
password=RANDOM_API_PASSWORD_KEY
@
A_RECORD
A_RECORD_TWO
#+END_SRC

If you need to dynamically update a subdomain then you need to subsititute host as subdomain. To dynamically update the domain itself (yourdomain.com), you need to replace host with @.

*PSA: _Stop using your SSH RSA keys from 10 years ago!_*

Changing your SSH key doesn't have to be hard, and it should be done. Please stop using your RSA keys with 1024 bit size.
Sadly, the default is still 2048 bits, which is still not good enough. If you're going to use RSA keys, ensure they're 4096 bits.
Best choice is to use ed25519 keys.

ssh-keygen generates, manages and converts authentication keys for [[https://man.openbsd.org/ssh][ssh(1)]].
ssh-keygen can create keys for use by SSH protocol version 2.

Generate a secure client SSH key.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -o -a 100
#+END_SRC

When prompted, /please/, type a password ([[https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent][ssh-agent(1)]] is your friend).
